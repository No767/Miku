## Miku (ミク)

Miku is a multipurpose bot focused on simplicity, speed and efficiency. Miku is designed to keep things simple, and easy to use. Miku includes an events system, where you can set different events and get reminded if they passed or not, just like on a regular calender. Miku also contains DisQuest, and in-house system to store and manage your xp. Miku shares some code from [Rin](https://github.com/No767/Rin) and later on will share some code from [Kumiko](https://github.com/No767/Kumiko).

# Features

# Prefix

Miku's current prefix is `/`. Miku currently uses slash commands, but used to use the `miku` prefix.

# History

Miku was a bot developed by one of my friends and it managed to get up to 100 servers. The old bot needed to go through verification, but it was more of an hassle to do so. Eventually the bot was taken offline, and deleted entirely. The reason remains unknown to why. Fast-forward 2 years later, I created this bot as a open-source version of the old bot. This bot is designed to be open-source, and is supposed to be the v2 of the old bot (the old bot was never fully open-sourced, but some of the cogs used are now some of the plugins found within the [EasyBot.py](https://github.com/Isaac-To/EasyBot.py) project).
